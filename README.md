# Image-Processing-
Malaria Cell Detection using Machine Learning
  †**************************************†
Millions of people die from Malaria all over the world. Female Anopheles is responsible for carrying this disease. Traditional methods are often tedious and error prone. So, image processing (particularly machine learning) can be a superior technique to overcome these limitations. It is also cost efficient. 
input will be in image form. output will be a feature of the image. 
  *****************************************
We will employ feature extraction technique (contour detection) and then RandomForest Classifier.
